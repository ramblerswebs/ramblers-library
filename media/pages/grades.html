        <h2>Important additional advice</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Walk grades are provided as a general guide only. If you have any doubt about your fitness for a particular walk please contact the organiser or leader in advance.</li>
            <li>Bear in mind the distance of the walk, regional differences in terrain and the possibility of bad weather, which can make a walk more difficult than planned.</li>
            <li>If you're unsure of your fitness level, try a short and easy walk first - it's much better to find a walk a little too slow and easy than to make yourself miserable and exhausted.</li>
            <li>Leaders may refuse to accept participants who in their opinion are inadequately equipped or unfit.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some of our volunteers use their own local grading systems. If this isn't explained in the walk description, contact the organiser or leader for details.</p>
